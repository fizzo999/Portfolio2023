# Project Name: Portfolio 2023

**Author**: ✨Fizzo Pannosch✨
**Version**: 3.0.0

## Deployed site @ https://fizzopannosch2023.netlify.app/

## Overview:

portfolio website that displays a information about me, Fizzo Pannosch, about my main it skills and have a contact page with working email form (implemented using email.js). This site also showcases a rocket-loader animation I built after a youtube tutorial from online-tutorialsYT and a parallax card animation that I implemented after some research how to do that in react. This si still a work in progress. To do's include a modal pop up window with a short video animation (either as a video tag with an mp4 preview file I already have - OR upload that file to youtube and use an iframe instead for faster page load and less memory demand on client).


## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/fizzo999/cityExplorer301n22.git
```

in order to clone this repo to your local machine.
Create a .env file with one important variable:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_SERVER=https://fizzo-city-explorer-server.herokuapp.com
```

and store that in your .env file. Be careful with the naming convention. Since this variable is used in the code it has to match in order to work
